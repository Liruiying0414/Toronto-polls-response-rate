Extract of the questions from @gebru2021datasheets.

The dataset discussed in this datasheet and used in "Analysis factors affecting voter participation rate"[@ropendata],obtained from Open data Toronto.

More relevant information could be found on the"Polls Regarding Changes in a Neighborhood"[@rpoll] by City of Toronto.




**Motivation**

1. *For what purpose was the dataset created? Was there a specific task in mind? Was there a specific gap that needed to be filled? Please provide a description.*
    - The dataset was created to facilitate the analysis of voter participation patterns in Toronto. Specifically, it aims to understand how municipal policies, such as parking regulations and business improvement initiatives, influence voter participation. The structured dataset addresses consolidated and accessible data on neighborhood polls insufficiency and provides a foundation for quantitative analysis and policymaking.

2. *Who created the dataset (for example, which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (for example, company, institution, organization)?*
    - The dataset was curated and published by the City of Toronto to the public through portal called Open Data Toronto.
    
3. *Who funded the creation of the dataset? If there is an associated grant, please provide the name of the grantor and the grant name and number.*
    - The dataset is maintained as part of the City of Toronto's open government initiative, funded by municipal resources.

4. *Any other comments?*
    - None.



**Composition**

1. *What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (for example, documents, photos, people, countries)? Are there multiple types of instances (for example, movies, users, and ratings; people and interactions between them; nodes and edges)? Please provide a description.*
	- Instances in the raw dataset represent neighborhood poll results in Toronto, specifically focusing on voter responses to municipal policy proposals. Each instance is linked to a unique poll and includes clear details about the poll's attributes with numeric and categorical outcomes.

2. *How many instances are there in total (of each type, if appropriate)?*
	- The dataset contains 1,296 instances in total, but the number would change as it was update monthly by City of Toronto.

3. *Does the dataset contain all possible instances or is it a sample (not necessarily random) of instances from a larger set? If the dataset is a sample, then what is the larger set? Is the sample representative of the larger set (for example, geographic coverage)? If so, please describe how this representativeness was validated/verified. If it is not representative of the larger set, please describe why not (for example, to cover a more diverse range of instances, because instances were withheld or unavailable).*
	- The dataset represents a full collection of neighborhood poll results available during the data collection period. However, it might not include polls conducted outside this timeframe or under specific exceptional conditions. The datasetâ€™s representativeness is reflected in its broad coverage of neighborhood-level polls across Toronto.

4. *What data does each instance consist of? "Raw" data (for example, unprocessed text or images) or features? In either case, please provide a description.*
	- Each instance in the raw dataset includes the following aspects: Poll identifiers (POLL_CD, POLL_ID); Address details (ADDRESS); Application type (APPLICATION_FOR); Voter counts (POTENTIAL_VOTERS, FINAL_VOTER_COUNT); Ballots information (BALLOTS_DISTRIBUTED, BALLOTS_CAST, BALLOTS_IN_FAVOUR, BALLOTS_OPPOSED, BALLOTS_SPOILED, BALLOTS_BLANK); Pass rates (PASS_RATE, RESPONSE_RATE_MET); Poll outcome (POLL_RESULT); Relevant dates (OPEN_DATE, CLOSE_DATE, MORATORIUM_DATE); Additional metadata (BALLOTS_NEEDED_TO_PROCEED).

5. *Is there a label or target associated with each instance? If so, please provide a description.*
	- Yes, key targets include PASS_RATE, it indicates percentage of votes in favor of a proposal, and RESPONSE_RATE_MET (whether voter participation met required thresholds).

6. *Is any information missing from individual instances? If so, please provide a description, explaining why this information is missing (for example, because it was unavailable). This does not include intentionally removed information, but might include, for example, redacted text.*
	- Some instances have missing values in fields like ADDRESS, likely due to incomplete administrative records or anonymization for privacy. Missing data affects a small subset of records and does not have huge impact dataset usability.

7. *Are relationships between individual instances made explicit (for example, users' movie ratings, social network links)? If so, please describe how these relationships are made explicit.*
	- Yes, relationships between instances are made explicit through unique poll identifiers (POLL_CD and POLL_ID). These identifiers link related voting attributes to a specific poll.

8. *Are there recommended data splits (for example, training, development/validation, testing)? If so, please provide a description of these splits, explaining the rationale behind them.*
	- The dataset is not pre-split, allowing users to determine appropriate splits based on their analysis needs. For example, splits could be based on poll types (APPLICATION_FOR) or geographic regions (ADDRESS).

9. *Are there any errors, sources of noise, or redundancies in the dataset? If so, please provide a description.*
	- The dataset contains redundant records, some missing value, and minor inconsistencies in metadata labels, and noise introduced by human error during data entry. These issues are minimal and were addressed during preprocessing for the cleaned dataset.

10. *Is the dataset self-contained, or does it link to or otherwise rely on external resources (for example, websites, tweets, other datasets)? If it links to or relies on external resources, a) are there guarantees that they will exist, and remain constant, over time; b) are there official archival versions of the complete dataset (that is, including the external resources as they existed at the time the dataset was created); c) are there any restrictions (for example, licenses, fees) associated with any of the external resources that might apply to a dataset consumer? Please provide descriptions of all external resources and any restrictions associated with them, as well as links or other access points, as appropriate.*
	- Yes, the dataset is self-contained and provides all necessary information for analyzing poll outcomes. However, external documents and policies referenced in the dataset such as city by-laws, was provided additional context.

11. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (for example, data that is protected by legal privilege or by doctor-patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals' non-public communications)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No. The dataset contains publicly available information collected from municipal records.

12. *Does the dataset contain data that, if viewed directly, might be offensive, insulting, threatening, or might otherwise cause anxiety? If so, please describe why.*
	- No. The dataset primarily contains neutral data about municipal poll results.

13. *Does the dataset identify any sub-populations (for example, by age, gender)? If so, please describe how these subpopulations are identified and provide a description of their respective distributions within the dataset.*
	- The dataset does not include explicit demographic data. However, geographic information (ADDRESS) could indirectly indicate neighborhood-level sub-populations.

14. *Is it possible to identify individuals (that is, one or more natural persons), either directly or indirectly (that is, in combination with other data) from the dataset? If so, please describe how.*
	- No. The dataset does not include individual-level information; all data is aggregated at the poll level.

15. *Does the dataset contain data that might be considered sensitive in any way (for example, data that reveals race or ethnic origins, sexual orientations, religious beliefs, political opinions or union memberships, or locations; financial or health data; biometric or genetic data; forms of government identification, such as social security numbers; criminal history)? If so, please provide a description.*
	- No. The dataset is limited to non-sensitive information about neighborhood-level polling outcomes.

16. *Any other comments?*
	- The dataset serves as a foundational resource for studying voter participation and evaluating the effectiveness of municipal policies.



**Collection process**

1. *How was the data associated with each instance acquired? Was the data directly observable (for example, raw text, movie ratings), reported by subjects (for example, survey responses), or indirectly inferred/derived from other data (for example, part-of-speech tags, model-based guesses for age or language)? If the data was reported by subjects or indirectly inferred/derived from other data, was the data validated/verified? If so, please describe how.*
